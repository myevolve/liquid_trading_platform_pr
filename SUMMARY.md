# Summary of Changes

## Type Compatibility Issues in ParameterOptimization Component

### Issues Fixed
1. Fixed type compatibility issues between local OptimizationResult type and imported OptimizationResult type:
   - Created a local interface `LocalOptimizationResult` to maintain backward compatibility
   - Added a conversion function `convertToOptimizationResult` to convert local results to the imported type
   - Updated the `onStartOptimization` prop type to use the local result type
   - Modified the `handleOptimize` function to convert results before setting state

2. Fixed Strategy type compatibility issues:
   - Updated the Strategy import to use the one from '@/types/strategy' instead of './StrategyBuilder'
   - Added a wrapper for the strategy object when passing it to ParameterSensitivity to ensure it has all required properties
   - Added default values for missing properties (parameters, createdAt, updatedAt)

3. Fixed component prop issues:
   - Updated the ParameterSensitivity component call to pass the required strategy prop
   - Ensured the strategy object has all required properties

### Remaining Issues
- Duplicate Strategy interfaces in different files (types/strategy.ts and components/trading/StrategyBuilder.tsx)
- Different OptimizationResult interfaces in different files
- Need to consolidate type definitions to avoid compatibility issues

## Testing Results
- All tests for the ParameterOptimization component are now passing
- The ParameterSensitivity tests are also passing (though most are skipped)
- There are still some failing tests in other components, particularly in the IndicatorConfig component

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test issues:
   - Fix uncontrolled/controlled input issues in OrderEntryForm
   - Address remaining type compatibility issues between different Strategy interfaces
   - Create proper mocks for components that are causing test failures

2. Consolidate type definitions:
   - Create a unified type system for indicators by moving all indicator types to a single file
   - Deprecate redundant interfaces like Indicator that extend TechnicalIndicator without adding properties
   - Document the type hierarchy for better maintainability
   - Consolidate duplicate Strategy interfaces in different files
   - Standardize OptimizationResult interfaces across the codebase

3. Update tests:
   - Update tests to work with the new type definitions
   - Ensure all tests pass with the updated types

4. Verify CI/CD pipeline:
   - Run the CI/CD pipeline to verify that the type issues are resolved
   - Monitor the pipeline execution
   - Verify successful deployment to the staging environment
