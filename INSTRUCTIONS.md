# Instructions for Applying Changes

Due to large files in the repository that exceed GitHub's file size limits, we were unable to push the changes directly to the main repository. Instead, we've created a separate repository with just the files that need to be updated.

## Files to Update

1. `frontend/src/components/trading/ParameterOptimization.tsx`
   - This file has been updated to fix type compatibility issues between local OptimizationResult type and imported OptimizationResult type.
   - It also fixes Strategy type compatibility issues and component prop issues.

2. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - This file has been updated with information about the ParameterOptimization component fixes.

## How to Apply the Changes

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/myevolve/liquid_trading_platform_pr.git
   ```

2. Copy the files to your local copy of the main repository:
   ```
   cp liquid_trading_platform_pr/frontend/src/components/trading/ParameterOptimization.tsx /path/to/liquid_trading_platform/frontend/src/components/trading/
   cp liquid_trading_platform_pr/TROUBLESHOOTING.md /path/to/liquid_trading_platform/
   ```

3. Commit and push the changes to the main repository:
   ```
   cd /path/to/liquid_trading_platform
   git checkout -b fix-parameter-optimization
   git add frontend/src/components/trading/ParameterOptimization.tsx TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   git commit -m "[Cursor] Fix type compatibility issues in ParameterOptimization component"
   git push -u origin fix-parameter-optimization
   ```

4. Create a pull request from the `fix-parameter-optimization` branch to the `main` branch.
