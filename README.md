# ParameterOptimization Component Fixes

This repository contains the fixes for the type compatibility issues in the ParameterOptimization component of the Liquid Trading Platform.

## Important: How to Apply These Changes

Due to large files in the main repository that exceed GitHub's file size limits, we were unable to push the changes directly to the main repository. Instead, we've created this separate repository with just the files that need to be updated.

**Please see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed instructions on how to apply these changes to the main repository.**

## Accomplishments

1. Fixed type compatibility issues between local OptimizationResult type and imported OptimizationResult type:
   - Created a local interface `LocalOptimizationResult` to maintain backward compatibility
   - Added a conversion function `convertToOptimizationResult` to convert local results to the imported type
   - Updated the `onStartOptimization` prop type to use the local result type
   - Modified the `handleOptimize` function to convert results before setting state

2. Fixed Strategy type compatibility issues:
   - Updated the Strategy import to use the one from '@/types/strategy' instead of './StrategyBuilder'
   - Added a wrapper for the strategy object when passing it to ParameterSensitivity to ensure it has all required properties
   - Added default values for missing properties (parameters, createdAt, updatedAt)

3. Fixed component prop issues:
   - Updated the ParameterSensitivity component call to pass the required strategy prop
   - Ensured the strategy object has all required properties

4. Updated documentation:
   - Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with details about the type issues fixed and remaining
   - Updated currentTask.md to reflect progress on fixing frontend test issues
   - Updated projectRoadmap.md to mark the task of fixing type compatibility issues in ParameterOptimization component as completed

## Testing Results

- All tests for the ParameterOptimization component are now passing
- The ParameterSensitivity tests are also passing (though most are skipped)
- There are still some failing tests in other components, particularly in the IndicatorConfig component

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test issues:
   - Fix uncontrolled/controlled input issues in OrderEntryForm
   - Address remaining type compatibility issues between different Strategy interfaces
   - Create proper mocks for components that are causing test failures

2. Consolidate type definitions:
   - Create a unified type system for indicators by moving all indicator types to a single file
   - Deprecate redundant interfaces like Indicator that extend TechnicalIndicator without adding properties
   - Document the type hierarchy for better maintainability
   - Consolidate duplicate Strategy interfaces in different files
   - Standardize OptimizationResult interfaces across the codebase

3. Update tests:
   - Update tests to work with the new type definitions
   - Ensure all tests pass with the updated types

4. Verify CI/CD pipeline:
   - Run the CI/CD pipeline to verify that the type issues are resolved
   - Monitor the pipeline execution
   - Verify successful deployment to the staging environment
