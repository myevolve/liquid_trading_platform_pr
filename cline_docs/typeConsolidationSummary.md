# Type Consolidation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully consolidated type definitions across the codebase to ensure consistency and prevent type compatibility issues. This involved moving duplicate type definitions to centralized type files and updating imports across the codebase.

## Accomplishments

### Type Consolidation
- Moved all indicator types to a single file (`types/indicators.ts`)
- Consolidated duplicate Strategy interfaces to `types/strategy.ts`
- Moved all optimization-related types to `types/optimization.ts`
- Updated imports across the codebase to use the consolidated types
- Removed duplicate type definitions from component files

### Type Compatibility Fixes
- Fixed type compatibility issues in ParameterOptimization component
- Fixed TechnicalIndicator interface in types/chart.ts
- Updated StrategyCondition type in types/strategy.ts
- Created conversion functions for type compatibility
- Fixed BacktestingComponent.tsx
- Fixed signalDetection.ts
- Fixed redeclarations in TradingChart.tsx
- Resolved type compatibility issues in TradingChart.tsx
- Fixed type compatibility issues in optimization files

### Adapter Functions
- Created adapter functions in typeConversions.ts to bridge the gap between different type structures
- Updated utils/optimization.ts and services/optimization.ts to use the adapter functions
- Implemented default parameter values for each indicator type

### Verification
- Ran the application to verify that all components work correctly with the consolidated types
- Reviewed test files for type compatibility issues
- Documented ESLint configuration issues related to TypeScript version compatibility

## Issues Identified

### ESLint Configuration Issues
- The project is using TypeScript 5.7.3, which is newer than the version range supported by the current ESLint configuration (>=4.3.5 <5.4.0)
- This version mismatch is causing compatibility issues with the ESLint TypeScript parser
- The specific error in SignalMarkers.tsx is related to the "@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-declaration-merging" rule

### Test Issues
- Several tests are skipped and might need to be updated to work with the new type definitions
- ConditionBuilder.test.tsx, BacktestingComponent.test.tsx, and StrategyBuilder.test.tsx need to be reviewed and updated

## Next Steps

### Create PR for Type Consolidation
- Create a PR for the type consolidation work
- Include a detailed description of the changes made
- Highlight the benefits of the type consolidation
- Mention the issues identified and the next steps

### Address ESLint Configuration Issues
- Create a separate task to address ESLint configuration issues
- Update ESLint configuration to support TypeScript 5.7.3
- Fix the specific rule issue in SignalMarkers.tsx

### Update Skipped Tests
- Create a separate task to update skipped tests
- Update ConditionBuilder.test.tsx to work with the new type definitions
- Update BacktestingComponent.test.tsx to work with the new type definitions
- Update StrategyBuilder.test.tsx to work with the new type definitions

## Lessons Learned
- When consolidating types, it's important to check all usages of the types to ensure compatibility
- String literal types (like `IndicatorType`) cannot have properties accessed on them directly
- When dealing with incompatible type structures, create adapter functions to bridge the gap
- Consider the impact of type changes on all parts of the codebase, especially utility functions that might have assumptions about type structures
- Always check version compatibility between TypeScript and ESLint plugins
- When upgrading TypeScript, make sure to also update related tools and configurations
